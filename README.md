### This repo contains the necessary artifacts to satisfy the requirements of this challenge.
| File | Description | 
| - | - |
| `api_challenge/output_data/Fig1.png` | Image capatured during the creation of the Max Temp vs. Latitude scatter plot. |
| `api_challenge/output_data/Fig2.png` | Image capatured during the creation of the Humidity vs. Latitude scatter plot. |
| `api_challenge/output_data/Fig3.png` | Image capatured during the creation of the Cloudiness vs. Latitude scatter plot. |
| `api_challenge/output_data/Fig4.png` | Image capatured during the creation of the Wind Speed vs. Latitude scatter plot. |
| `api_challenge/output_data/cities.csv` | Resulting city dataset after searching for nearest cities based on random latitude/longitude.  Used as input for the rest of the challenge. |
| `api_challenge/output_data/ideal_location_map_plot.png` | Saved image from the ideal location/hotel map.  Used `hvplot.save()`, but didn't keep this code in the notebook because it required an additional library (selenium) and produced warnings in the output. |
| `api_challenge/output_data/world_map_plot.png` | Saved image from the city world map.  Used `hvplot.save()`, but didn't keep this code in the notebook because it required an additional library (selenium) and produced warnings in the output. |
| `api_challenge/VacationPy.ipynb` | Source code for Part 2 of the challenge: Plotting cities on the world map along with vacation/hotel destinations. |
| `api_challenge/WeatherPy.ipynb` | Source code for Part 1 of the challenge: Retrieving city weather data and creating statistical analysis based on temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. |
| `.gitignore` | File used to prevent the api keys used to generate the data in this challenge from being pushed to source control. |
| `README.md` | This file. |
